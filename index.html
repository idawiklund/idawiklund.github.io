						<h4 class="just">I am currently a MSc student in Interaction Design, at Umeå University. This means that I am currently learning how to find creative and interactive solutions between human and machine. After the studies, I am aiming to work with both front-end and back-end development at some point. I think all kinds of programing is interesting.</h4>

					<div class="AboutMeText2">
						<p>I am from a small town in the northern of Sweden called Skellefteå and moved to Umeå to study. When I started studying, I commuted from Skellefteå in 2,5 years. I studied some extra courses and worked a little in the daycare as well. In my spare time I cuddle with my cats, train, sing and hang out with friends and family. One of my biggest hobbies is to sing and it is also one of my most important tools to unwind. I also like to play football, but I do not play very often since I stopped playing in Bureå's women's team as a 17 year old. When it comes to programming, I like to learn new things and challenge myself. I have noticed that the more I learn, the more fun it gets, and being able to connect programming with design is even better. In the future I would like to work as a programmer and also connect it with some kind of designing.</p><br>
